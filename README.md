A repository of testing examples.  

A list of things still to try and investigate [TODO.md](./TODO.md)  

## Conventional Commits

NOTE: This repo has switched to [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0). It requires `pre-commit` and `commitizen` to help with controlling this.  

```sh
# install pre-commmit (prerequisite for commitizen)
brew install pre-commit
brew install commitizen
# conventional commits extension
code --install-extension vivaxy.vscode-conventional-commits

# install hooks
pre-commit install --hook-type commit-msg --hook-type pre-push
```
